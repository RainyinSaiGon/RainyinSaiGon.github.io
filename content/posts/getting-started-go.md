<h2>Why Go for Static Site Generation?</h2>

<p>Go is perfect for building fast, efficient static site generators. It compiles to a single binary, making deployment simple.</p>

<h2>Project Setup</h2>

<p>This portfolio site uses a simple but powerful approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read markdown files from <code>content/posts/</code></li>
<li>Parse metadata from frontmatter</li>
<li>Generate HTML from templates</li>
<li>Output to <code>public/</code> for deployment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>Add more posts by creating <code>.md</code> files in <code>content/posts/</code> with the same format as this file!</p>
