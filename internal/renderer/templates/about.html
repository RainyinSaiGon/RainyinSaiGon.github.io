        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-5">I'm RainyinSaiGon, a student and software developer based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. At school, I research machine learning algorithms and applications. During my free time, I usually work on side projects or learn new techniques. My goal is to create helpful tools and applications with intuitive and presentable interfaces.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-10">I'm glad you've come across my website. This is where I organize and share my thoughts and experiences. I'll try to write about my notes or opinions about certain topics I recently encountered, especially those that I found interesting or had the most trouble articulating.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mb-4">Tech stack</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">Go is my primary language for building this site and backend tooling. I also work with JavaScript, Python, and C. I enjoy understanding how things work at a low level and reaching for the right tool for each job.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">For personal projects, I prefer building from scratch for educational purposes. For front-ends I enjoy working with modern frameworks, and for back-ends I favour simplicity and performance. This site is built with a custom static-site generator written in Go because of its simplicity, speed, and full control over the output.</p>
